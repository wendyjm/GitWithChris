<h1>HTML5 for News</h1>
<h2>Is anyone using semantic HTML5 for news content?</h2>
<main aria-label="main content">
  <p>4 March 2017. I checked out NPR's code to see if they used HTML5 to markup their articles — since they were pioneers in the COPE model (an approach that makes an incredible amount of sense to me). </p>
  <h3>Main Tag</h3>
  <p>I read on stackexchange that you still need to use an ARIA label — main aria-label="main content" with the main tag. Some technology hasn't caught up with HTML5 yet. http://w3c.github.io/aria-in-html/
